    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>Born and bred in Central Kenya, I was educated in the Protestant Mission
      area of Thogoto in Kikuyu town, atttending Musa Gitau Primary School and
      thereafter Alliance High School. Higher education took me to the yet another
      faith based University, Strathmore University for A Bcom in Accounting.
      Leadership roles have defined me throughout this path. My sister relentlessly
      reminded me that age does not mean to maturity.</p>

      <<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>By mid 2018, I had wokred in development finance, micro-finance
      lending,agricultural management, insurance intermediation and transaction advisory.
      In all these fields, computers planned  large part in athe accomplishment of tasks and processes.
    Thus, an interest grew gradually. I have now set out on the journey to learn computers from a
  a more intimate perspective, coding. I am presently enrolled in Moringa School, a coding accelator/bootcamp.
</p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>I foresee Security needs growing exponentially as computing continues to play
  a bigger role in everyday life. With Social Media, IoT, Machine Learning and Virtual Reality
serving daily needs and wants for Kenyans, I hope to play an integral part in
securing these applications. </p>

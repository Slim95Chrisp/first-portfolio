    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>Born and bred in Central Kenya, I was educated in the Protestant Mission
      area of Thogoto in Kikuyu town, atttending Musa Gitau Primary School and
      thereafter Alliance High School. Higher education took me to the yet
      another faith based University, Strathmore University for A Bcom in
      Accounting. Leadership roles have defined me throughout this path.</p>

      <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>By mid 2018, I had wokred in development finance, micro-finance
      lending,agricultural management, insurance intermediation and transaction
      advisory.In all these fields, computers planned  large part in the
      accomplishment of tasks and processes.Thus, an interest grew gradually.
      I have now set out on the journey to learn computers from a more intimate
      perspective, coding. I am presently enrolled in
      <a href="https://www.moringaschool.com/"><em>Moringa School</em></a>,
      a coding accelator/bootcamp.</p>
      <p>With guidance from Technical Mentors and through blended learning, I'll
      learn the following languages: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </ol>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>I foresee <strong>Security</strong> needs growing exponentially as
    computing continues to play a bigger role in everyday life. With Social
    Media, IoT, Machine Learning and Virtual Reality serving daily needs and
    wants for Kenyans,I hope to play an integral part in securing these
    applications.</p>

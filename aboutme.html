    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p class="intro">Born and bred in Central Kenya, I was educated in the
      Protestant Mission area of Thogoto in Kikuyu town. Higher education
      took me to a faith based University for Commerce degree in <span

      <p class="intro">By mid 2018, I had worked in development finance, micro-finance
      lending,agricultural management, insurance intermediation and transaction
      advisory.In all these fields, computers planned  large part in the
      accomplishment of tasks and processes.Thus, an interest grew gradually.
      I have now set out on the journey to learn computers from a more intimate
      perspective, coding. I am presently enrolled in
